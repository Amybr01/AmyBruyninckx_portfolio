            <h2>Step 1: Understanding the challenge</h2>
            <p>For this assignment, we are tasked with designing a dynamic movie poster, specifically focusing on
                director Christopher Nolan. Each student selects a Nolan film, watches it for inspiration, and proceeds
                with the following steps:</p>
            <p>Research the film, research Christopher Nolan, and brainstorm an original idea. Determine the poster's
                content and hierarchy, including the film title, director, cast, production house, slogan, and release
                date. Describe the style, color, typography, and motion, create a moodboard, and sketch three static
                designs with arguments. Choose one proposal to develop digitally, create a storyboard for transitioning
                from static to dynamic, and implement the design in HTML and CSS with animations.</p>

        <section id="research">
            <h2>Step 2: Research and inspiration</h2>
            <p>To kick off my journey, I delved into the rich history of web design, studying iconic designs and
                innovative CSS techniques. I explored various design blogs, galleries, and CSS showcases to gather
                inspiration for my own design.</p>

        <section id="ideation">
            <h2>Step 3: Ideation and brainstorming</h2>
            <p>With a wealth of inspiration at my disposal, I began brainstorming ideas for my CSS Zen Garden design. I
                sketched out rough concepts, experimented with color palettes, and explored different layout
                possibilities. This stage allowed me to unleash my creativity and explore a wide range of design
                possibilities.</p>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Step 4: Implementation and experimentation</h2>
            <p>Once I had a clear vision for my design, I dove into the implementation phase. I started by crafting the
                CSS rules to style the HTML markup provided by the CSS Zen Garden. This process involved trial and
                error, as I experimented with different CSS properties and techniques to achieve the desired visual
                effects.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="refinement">
            <h2>Step 5: Refinement and iteration</h2>
            <p>After completing the initial implementation, I stepped back to evaluate my design. I conducted thorough
                testing across different devices and screen sizes to ensure a seamless user experience. I solicited
                feedback from peers and mentors, incorporating their suggestions to refine and improve my design.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="presentation">
            <h2>Step 6: Presentation and showcase</h2>
            <p>With my design polished and perfected, I prepared to showcase my CSS Zen Garden creation to the world. I
                crafted a compelling presentation to highlight the unique features and design choices of my project. I
                shared my work on social media, design forums, and personal portfolio to inspire and engage with fellow
                designers.</p>
